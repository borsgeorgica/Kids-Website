					<h1>Match the pairs</h1>
					<p>	Our newest implemented game! This is called match the pairs. To begin with the player is provided with a 4X4 grid of tiles. Each tile on the grid contains an image that is initially covered by an image of the company's logo. Upon the first click the tile selected will uncover in order to reveal the picture that is hidden behind. After clicking for the second the on another tile the picture behind it will be yet again revealed. If the pictures behind the two tiles that have been selected match then the tiles will remain uncovered otherwise they will just revert back to being covered. The aim of the game is to uncover all the tiles.</p>

					<h1>Spot the difference</h1>
					<p>	Here is the second game that we have implemented on this website. The game works by providing you with two similar pictures which will look identical but will have some slight differences within it. The aim of the game is to spot these differences between the two pictures provided. Some differences may be easier to spot than others in order to make the puzzle more challanging and entertaining. There will be 3 rounds to the game and all 3 roudns must be completed in order to complete the whole game.</p>

					<h1>Sliding blocks puzzle</h1>
					<p>	One of the first games that we have implemented on our website was the Sliding blocks puzzle. This puzzle game consists of a picture which is jumpled up into pieces inside a 3X3 grid. One square of the grid will be empty. Each movement of the other squares in the attempt to reconstruct the picture should be done by clicking a picture around the empty tile which will cause the square selected to swap places with the empty tile. The game is completed upon getting all the jumpled up bits of the picture into the right order.</p>
