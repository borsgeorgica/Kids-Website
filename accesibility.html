				<p>&#8226;First of all we have given alt attributes to all of our pictures of the website in order to allow screen readers used by people with vision disabilities to have full access to further content on our website.</p>
				<p>&#8226;Secondly we have made sure that the contrast of colours between different elements on the pages is different in order to allow the users who are colour blind to easily distinguish between the elements.</p>
				<p>&#8226;Thirdly our fonts are generally quite large in size so that people who have poor eyesight can read everything on the webpages easily.</p>
				<p>&#8226;The pictures we append on the website are quite small in size and have been well optimised so that they have a fast loading time. This allows people with low internet bandwith to still have a fairly quick load time of the webpage so that they don't have to wait for long periods of time when loading a specific page.</p>
				<p>&#8226;The website is accessible on multiple devices. This allows access to the site regardless of what device you are using.</p>
				<p>&#8226;Lastly we have optimised our website to make sure that it can be used and accessed correctly from multiple browsers.</p>

				<p>As a serious company we are trying to be as professional as possible in addressing accessibility issues. Therefore this website follows the W3C's accessibility criteria to further improve our website. Please have a look at the list on the left in order to see more detailed explanations of how we address accessibility issues.</p>
