					<p>My name is Georgica Bors, I am 19 years old and my role in the company can be best described as the Lead Website Developer. I have created this website not very long ago as a university assignment and to my surprise there has been a high number of website visitors since launching the website. Due to this large number of customers I have managed to extend the development team in order to be able to keep up with the workload in order to add new content. In my spare time I enjoy playing golf as I have done this from a very young age. I have a passion for developing websites of any kind and creating high quality content for my visitors.</p>

					<p>I am Alexandra Butoi and I am the Appearance Editor here at Virtual Playground. I've joined the company not very long ago and I've enjoyed working here from the very first moment. My main priorities are making sure that the content of the webpage is eyecatching and appealing as well as ensuring that it follows the accessibility criteria standards. I take great pride for my work and always look at the feedback received so that I can meet the damands of the users.</p>

					<p>My name is Daniel Anghel, I'm currently 24 years old and I am the Content Developer. My job at Virtual Playground is to find high quality content on the web and bring it all over here on this website for everyone to read. The content that I pick is selected very carefuly so that it appeals to kids as this is the main target audience for this website. I have many hobbies that I do during the time I am not at work and I would say my favourite one of them all would be skydiving.</p>
